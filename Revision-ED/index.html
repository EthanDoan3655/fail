<h2>NEO TOKYO</h2>
      <p>On 16 July 1988, a singularity destroyed much of Tokyo. Sometime after the end of the Third World War, people built Neo-Tokyo on a big artificial island in Tokyo Bay. The city is described as a booming, industrial city with the atmosphere of a collapsing one. Neo-Tokyo is situated on an enormous, man-made island with dozens of smaller artificial islands in Tokyo Bay. They're all interconnected with bridges, tunnels, etc. Tokyo Bay is in the Kant≈ç region of Honshu. Honshu is the largest main island of Japan, with a population of 21,451,800 and the total area of the city is 410.32 km2. This would make Neo-Tokyo the most densely-populated city in the world after the original city.</p>
